1) Adding new fonts
When adding custom fonts make sure that the name of the font in 
the .fnt file is unique, otherwise Nifty will use some other font.
To fix this open your font .fnt file and change this:
 - info face="Your font name here which must be unique"


2) HTML
Not much HTML is supported, see examples here of 
what you can use: https://github.com/void256/nifty-gui/tree/1.3/nifty-html/src/test/resources/html

3) Nifty gui: 
 - (See file myNavigationWidgetControl_WADS.xml for example)
 -  MUST HAVE A PANEL WITH #window-content id as first(top) element and the controlDefition must have attribute childRootId="#window-content" or you cant access children  in java
