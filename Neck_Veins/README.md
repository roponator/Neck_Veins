#Neck Veins

MPUI branch of Neck Veins app. It features robust MPUI algorithm with parallelised approximation and polygonisation. 

Workflow:

Run program and open an .mhd file. It will automatically generate object with configuration set in si.uni_lj.fri.MPU_Implicits.Configuration. Generated model will be saved in root directory of the project. The program tends to drain your PC resources, so be careful.

If you encounter any problems when using the app, you can contact me on milos.lukic10@gmail.com
